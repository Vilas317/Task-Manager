## 📋 Task Manager – CRUD Based Todo App

This is a simple yet powerful **Task Manager web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to:

- 🆕 **Create new tasks**
- 📄 **View all tasks**
- ✏️ **Edit existing tasks**
- ❌ **Delete tasks**
- ✅ **Mark tasks as completed**
- 🔍 **Filter tasks by All, Completed, or Pending**

This project was built as part of an interview assignment to demonstrate understanding of **CRUD operations, DOM manipulation, and clean UI structuring**.  
It’s a perfect showcase of front-end logic, dynamic UI updates, and responsive design.
